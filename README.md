# Realtime Display of Tesla Stock Price
<img src="$TSLA Stock Display.jpg" alt="Tesla Display Picture">

I made the $TSLA stock price display (pictured above) by using a raspberry pi zero w, a breadboard, and a 1602 lcd display. 

I am a $TSLA shareholder and believe very strongly in their mission, so I just wanted to connect my two interests and build a project to display the stock price in real time so that I would just glance over and see the price.
