# tsla_stock_display


a real time $TSLA stock price display using a raspberry pi zero w, breadboard, and 1602 lcd display. 

i really just wanted to use a rasp pi zero and see how it works compared to the 4b i have for my rick robot. 
my overall take thus far: it is so tiny and was only $10! it is very slow compared to the 4b- which is very self explanatory is you look at the specs of this little guy. but i love this little thing! very fun 

i am a $TSLA shareholder and believe very strongly in their mission, so i just wanted to connect my two interests and build a project to display the stock price in real time so i can glance over and see it. 

contact me if you have any further questions!
