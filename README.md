# Realtime Display of Tesla Stock Price

a real time $TSLA stock price display using a raspberry pi zero w, breadboard, and 1602 lcd display. 

i am a $TSLA shareholder and believe very strongly in their mission, so i just wanted to connect my two interests and build a project to display the stock price in real time so i can just simply glance over and see what it was at.
